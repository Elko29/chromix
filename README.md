# Important

This project has now been superseded by
[chromix-too](https://github.com/smblott-github/chromix-too). If you're a new
user (or an existing user who's willing to make the switch), then I suggest
that you consider using chromix-too instead.


# Chromix

Chromix is a command-line and scripting utility for controlling Google chrome.
It can be used, amongst other things, to create, switch, focus, reload and
remove tabs.

For full information, see the [project web page](http://chromix.smblott.org/).
